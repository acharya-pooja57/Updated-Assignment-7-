The first two rows that contain RNAseq data show the gene expression as it shows how much DNA gets transcribed to RNA. Whereas the next two rows that contain the ATACseq data show the open chromatin region in between which the gene expression is carried out which is also proved by the last two rows that show the peak value in the open chromatin region. No data or peak in non coding open chromatin region for both late and early development data shows that while generating those data the overlapping region with exon was cut off using bedtools. Based on how much open chromatin region is present in the ATAC-seq data, the peak in the open chrromatin region varies accordingly which is shown by last two lines with varying shades of green color
